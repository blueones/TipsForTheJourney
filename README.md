# TipsForTheJourney
### Never stops writing side projects to understand how things are set up. (You don't even need to finish the projects.) For a junior dev, working is learning. Yet a senior dev is asked to deliver, this suddenly raises the bar and writing side projects can help gain that experience at a faster speed and provide exposure.
### While reading to understand systems, try implementing them in code to gain actual digestion of the content.
### Never rush into a project before writing up a dev plan. For a senior dev, a dev plan is extremely important and impactful. Changing the dev plan as the project progresses is much more costly since a whole team would have been assigned tasks according to the original dev plan. Learn to write a dev plan as if it's cast in stone. This requires researching and pilots beforehand. Learn about how to write a good development plan.
### Be specific when describing tech problems. 
### Be able to make long term committment in contrary to making 2 weeks commitment. Being able to make long term commitment shows the ability to navigate through ambiguity and make milestone plans, which is an essential character of a senior developer, a leader. 
### Understand that asking for help is normal and don't get caught up in your own ego. Your manager wants to help you succeed, and management wants to help move projects along. Ask good questions and be able to ask for help when help is needed.
